# Bubble-Popper

This is a personal game that started off as a class project. Currently, the objective of the game is to prevent any bubbles from reaching the top of the screen while avoiding the underwater mines.


Future Features:
  - Users will be able to view both their own high scores and the high scores of others
  - There will be a system in place such that it'll become more difficult as time passes
